# SugarDropper
SugarDropper for homebrewers to to drop precise sugar solution into bottles.
Batch priming by using bottling bucket or not is simple but introduce of oxygen is inevitable, i.e. either at the time the beer runs into bucket or fermenters are opened and sugar is dropped. 
Adding priming sugar into bottles alleviates oxygen problem a little bit, but it is PITA. It is the second worst thing for me in bottling.
SugarDropper comes to the rescue!
Prepare 50Brix sugar solution, run the dropper to calibrate, and drop specified amount of sugar solution by a button press. Yeah! I am moving to solve the problem I hated most in bottling.
