# SugarDropper
SugarDropper is designed for homebrewers to to dose precise sugar solution into bottles. Kaursening/Speise is supported, too.
Batch priming by using bottling bucket or not is simple, but the introduce of oxygen is inevitable, i.e. either at the time the beer runs into bucket or fermenters are opened and sugar is dropped. 
Adding priming sugar into bottles alleviates oxygen problem a little bit, but it is PITA, which is the second worst thing for me in bottling. SugarDropper is a simple project that help me in bottling day.

# Note
It is a simple but helpful, yet fun, project. Use the code as you like, and modify the code whatever you want.
Don't ask for Imperial unit support.
